These notes cover [How the Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) by explaining how Javascript, HTML and CSS work together to create a website. [Website Design and Process](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like) explains best practices one should use to effectively create a website.

1. **HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** An application procotol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. After the DNS is found by the browser, HTTP is used to send a request message to the server. This request asks for a copy of the website to be sent to the client. If the server approves, it sends  a "200 OK" message, which confirms and sends the website's files in data packets.

2. When browsers send requests to servers for HTML files, those HTML files often contain `<link>` elements referencing external CSS stylesheets and `<script>` elements referencing external JavaScript scripts. There is an order in which the files are parsed in the brower:

    1. The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any `<link>`-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any `<script>`-element references to scripts.
    2. As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from `<link>` elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from `<script>` elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.
    3. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.
    4. As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.

3. Images can be found via [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl). Most images on the web are copyrighted. It is best practice to use Google's license filter by clicking on *Tools* > *Usage Rights*, and clicking on the option *Creative Commons licenses*. This will reduce the risk of you violating copyright.
    - When you find the image you want, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it.
    - You can save the image in safe place on your computer, or you can copy the web address that belongs to the image you are selecting.

4. In Javascript, a string is created with text that is wrapped with either double quotation marks `""` or single quotation marks `''`. A number is created just by simply adding number with no quotation marks.

***Example:***

```
// This is a string

let variableString = "This is a string"

// This is a number

let variableNumber = 42
```

5. A `Variable` is a container where values are stored. Variables are most commonly delcared with the keywords `let`, `const`, `var`. A variable can also be delcared with no keywords.

***Example:***

```
let variableOne = 1;
const variableTwo = 2;
var variableThree = 3;
variableFour = 4;
```
