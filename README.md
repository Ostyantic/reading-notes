# **Osty's Code Fellows Notebook**

## About Me

Hello! My name is Anthony. I love playing video games and I go by Ostyantic (or Osty) in the gaming community. Some genres of games that I like are Turn-based Strategy, FPS, Fighters, MMOs, and party games. I also love playing board/card games. I have 2 cats, both siblings. Their names are Shadow and Onyx and they are the chillest cats I've ever known.  I am really excited to be here and experiencing (and conquering) my new coding journey with Code Fellows! :sunglasses:
