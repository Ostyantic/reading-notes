What does **"Having a _Growth Mindset_"** mean to me?

A Growth mindset, to me, means striving for growing and learning more despite the challenges one might face. To me, a strong mind it paramount to achieving growth and ultimately, success.

3 Reminders To Myself To Stay In A Growth Mindset:
1. Never give up, every challenge is meant to be conquered. Failure is not an option.:no_good_man:
2. If I am frustrated with something, take a break and tackle the problem again.
3. Ask for help, if it's needed; Collab with others.
