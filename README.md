# Osty's Code Fellows Notebook
## Growth Mindset

### What does **"Having a _Growth Mindset_"** mean to me? :thinking:

A growth mindset, to me, means striving for growing and learning more despite the challenges one might face. I believe a strong mind is paramount to achieving growth and ultimately, success.

3 Reminders To Myself To Stay In A Growth Mindset:
1. Never give up, every challenge is meant to be conquered. Failure is not an option.:no_good_man:
2. Frustrated? :fire::brain::fire: Take a break and tackle the problem again.
3. Nothing is impossible with commitment and dedication. :muscle:
