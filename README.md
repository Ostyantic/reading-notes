# **Osty's Code Fellows Notebook**
## **Growth Mindset**

### **What does having a _"Growth Mindset"_ mean to me?** 🤔

A growth mindset, to me, means striving for growing and learning more despite the challenges one might face. I believe a strong mind is paramount to achieving growth and ultimately, success.

### **3 Reminders To Myself To Stay In A Growth Mindset:**
1. Never give up, every challenge is meant to be conquered. Failure is not an option. 🙅‍♂️
2. Frustrated? 🔥 🧠 🔥 Take a break and tackle the problem again.
3. Nothing is impossible with commitment and dedication. 💪
