# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It's basically a simple way to format plain text by using symbols like asterisks, dashes, underscores, etc. to style your page and give it structure.

+ Easy to read and write

+ Customizeable
+ Versitile with different document types

### **How does it work?**

```
# Largest heading (h1)
## The second largest heading (h2)
###### The smallest heading (h6)
```

Headings are created using the "hashtag" symbol. This tell markdown to conver the text into a heading. Up to six (6) hashtags can be used when creating a heading. When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents which you can access by clicking  within the file header.

## Styling Text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and ``.md`` files.

`**bold**` or `__bold__` creates **bold** text

`*italic*`` or ``_italic_` creates *italic* text

`**Bold and _nested_ italic**` creates **bold and _nested_ italic text**

`***All bold and italic***` creates text that is all ***bold and italic***

`~~Strikethrough~~` creates text with a ~~strikethrough~~ line over it

## Lists

You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

### Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

### Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

 - Apples
 - Oranges
 - Pears
 - Grapes

#### Nested List
Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

1. Item 1
    1. Nested item 1
2. Item 2
    1. Nested item 2

- Apples
    - Honeycrisp
- Grapes
    - Green
