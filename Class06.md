# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## **What is Javascript?**

JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web. It is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers. It lets the user interact with a webpage.

## **3 major parts to distinguish what is refered to as "Javascript"**

1. The language itself.
2. The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser.
3. The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.

## **Embed or Include?**

Similar to CSS, you can either embed the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML file, or you can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file. In most cases the latter is recommended.

## **Functions**

**alert**

This will show a pop-up in the browser with the text.

Example:

```
<script language="javascript">
 
alert("Hello World");
 
</script>
```

**document.write**

```
1. First line
2. <script>
3.  
4. document.write("<h1>Hello World</h1>");
5.
6. </script>
7. Last line
```

The JavaScript code uses the document.write function to change the content of the page. It will embed the html snippet `<h1>Hello World</h1>` after the "First line", but before the "Last line".

**console.log**

Most of the web browsers provide what is called a "JavaScript console". It is an additional window which is normally not visible, where the browser can print out warnings and errors generated by the execution of the JavaScript code.

Example:

```
<script>
 
console.log("Hello World");
 
</script>
```

Displays "Hello World" in the console.

**prompt**

This function shows a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the `prompt()` function.

```
<script>
 
var name = prompt("Your name:", "");
document.write("Hello ", name);
 
</script>
```

**confirm**

This function allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question. Calling the `confirm()` function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons. If the user presses "OK" the `confirm()` function will return `true`, if the user presses "cancel" or hits the ESC key, the function will return `false`.

## **Variables**

Variables are containers for storing data. There are 4 ways to delcare a variable in Javascript:

- Using `var` (Used in older JS code)
- Using `let` (Used if the variable can/will change)
- Using `const` (Used if the variable doesn't change)
- Using nothing (Mostly used in Python)

## **Javascript Identifiers**

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are call identifiers. They can be short names (like x and y) or be more descriptive (like age, sum).

There is a general rule for constructing names:

- JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
