# **Version Control(VCS) & Git**

Version control is a system that allows one to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
With Version control, one can:

- revert a file or project to a previous version
- track modifications and modifying individuals
- compare changes
- fix mistakes with files

## **Different Types of Version Control**

*Local Version Control* - A VCS that consists of one database on a hard disk that stores changes to files.

*Centralized Version Control(CVCS)* - A VCS that consists of a single server that stores all changes and file version that can be accessed by multiple clients.

*Distributed Version Control(DVCS)* - Does what CVCSs do, but better. This system allows clients to mirrored repositories so that in case data is lost, they can easily be backed up since there are basically multiple mirrored copies. This system also allows programmers to collaborate with each other to complete joint projects.

## What is Git?

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Whenever a change is made and save, aka commit, Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores it for later reference.
