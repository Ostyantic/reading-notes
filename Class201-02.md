## Intro Statement

This topic covers the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## HTML

### Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Without the use of semantic elements, web pages have no structure. The following are potential issues of having a web page without semantic elements:

- This would make it hard for users to read or find the content the are looking for and likely become frustrated and go elsewhere.
- earch engines indexing your page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings. Without headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
- Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is done with software called a screen reader. This software provides ways to get fast access to given text content. Among the various techniques used, they provide an outline of the document by reading out the headings, allowing their users to find the information they need quickly. If headings are not available, they will be forced to listen to the whole document read out loud.
- To style content with CSS, or make it do interesting things with JavaScript, you need to have elements wrapping the relevant content, so CSS/JavaScript can effectively target it.

### How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

There can be up to six (6) levels of headings in the HTML document: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h6>`, and `<h6>`. Each of these elements represent a different level of content; `<h1>` represents the main heading. `<h2>` through `<h6>` are subheadings and sub-subheadings of the previous subheadings.

Example from [HTML text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals):

```
<!-- Main header -->
<h1>The Crushing Bore</h1>

<p>By Chris Mills</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: The dark night</h2>

<p>
  It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on the…
</p>

<!-- Subheader -->
<h2>Chapter 2: The eternal silence</h2>

<p>Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure…</p>

<!-- Sub-subheader -->
<h3>The specter speaks</h3>

<p>
  Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
  upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"
</p>

```

### What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?

The `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements are used when marking up items such as dates, chemical formulas, and mathematical equations.

Example from [Advanced text formatting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting):

```
<p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
<p>
  Caffeine's chemical formula is
  C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>
```

### When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

The `<title>` attribute should be added to provide the full expansion of the abbreviated word

Example from [Advanced text formatting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting):

```
<p>
  We use <abbr>HTML</abbr>, Hypertext Markup Language, to structure our web
  documents.
</p>

<p>
  I think <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Green did it in the kitchen with
  the chainsaw.
</p>

```

## CSS

### What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

There are 3 ways to apply CSS to HTML:

- **External**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first CSS example</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

- **Internal**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first CSS example</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

- **Inline**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid black;">
      Hello World!
    </h1>
    <p style="color:red;">This is my first CSS example</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

### Why should we avoid using inline styles?

One should avoid using inline styling because it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.

### Review the block of code below and answer the following questions

```
   h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }
```

1. What is representing the selector?
    - h2 is representing the `<h2>` tag
2. Which components are the CSS declarations?
    - The properties and values (`color: black;` and `padding: 5px;`) inside the curly brackets `{}` are the CSS declarations
3. Which components are considered properties?
    - The `color` and `padding` are the properties

## Javascript

### What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

| Variable | Explanation | Example |
|:---  |      :-----:       |:---     |
|String|This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.|let myString = 'This is a string'|

### List 4 types of JavaScript operators

| Variable | Explanation | Symbol(s) | Example |
|:---      |   :-----:   |  :-----:  |:---     |
|Assignment|This assigns a value to a variable|=|let myVariable = 'Bob';|
|Addition|Add two numbers together or combine two strings|+|1 + 1|
|Logical AND|Returns expr1 if it can be converted to false; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, && returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, returns false.|&&|expr1 && expr2|
|Logical OR|Returns expr1 if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns expr2. Thus, when used with Boolean values, &#124;&#124; returns true if either operand is true; if both are false, returns false.|&#124;&#124;|expr1 &#124;&#124; expr2|

### Describe a real world problem you could solve with a Function

An if statement checks a `Condition` and if it evaluates to `true`, then the code block will execute.

### What is the use of an `else if`?

### List 3 different types of comparison operators

### What is the difference between the logical operator `&&` and `||`?
