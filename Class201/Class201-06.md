# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## Intro Statement

## JS Object Basics

### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

Think of an object like a box. We create this "box" and fill it with things like properties (data like names & numbers) and methods (functions). After filling this "box with properties and methods, we can close the box and retrieve our items (properties and methods) whenever we want. It basically makes our javascript code more organized by giving our code their own separate boxes

## What are some advantages to creating object literals?

- When you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database
- Easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

## How do objects differ from arrays?

## Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation

## Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using `this`?

```
const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
```
