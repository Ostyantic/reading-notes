# CSS Layout

## Intro Statement

This topic introduces us to flexboxes. Flexboxes are really cool because they allow us to create "boxes" that dyanmically adjust the content that is displayed on the users browser window. Flexboxes are widely used across many webpages!

## CSS - Flexbox

### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

This mean flexbox is designed for content that is only going in one direction (i.e a row or a column).

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis

In the context of `flex-direction: row;`, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis perpendicular to the main axis.

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

The `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

## Layout - Flexbox

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

Flexbox can:

- vertically center a block of content inside its parent.
- make all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available
- make all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

### How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

It gives me a whole new perspective on how to style my webpage. Flexbox adds organization to a webpage that is also dynamic across different viewport sizes.
