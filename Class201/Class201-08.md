## Intro Statement

## CSS - Flexbox

### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

This mean flexbox is designed content that is only going in one direction (i.e a row or a column).

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis

In the context of `flex-direction: row;`, the main axis is horizontal and the cross axis is verticle.

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

The `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

## Layout - Flexbox

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

Flexbox can:

- vertically center a block of content inside its parent.
- make all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available
- make all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
