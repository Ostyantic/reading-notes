## Intro

These notes cover [How the Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) by explaining how Javascript, HTML and CSS work together to create a website. [Website Design and Process](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like) explains best practices one should use to effectively create a website.

1. **HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** An application procotol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. After the DNS is found by the browser, HTTP is used to send a request message to the server. This request asks for a copy of the website to be sent to the client. If the server approves, it sends  a "200 OK" message, which confirms and sends the website's files in data packets.

2. When browsers send requests to servers for HTML files, those HTML files often contain `<link>` elements referencing external CSS stylesheets and `<script>` elements referencing external JavaScript scripts. There is an order in which the files are parsed in the brower:

    1. The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any `<link>`-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any `<script>`-element references to scripts.
    2. As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from `<link>` elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from `<script>` elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.
    3. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.
    4. As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.

3. Images can be found via [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl). Most images on the web are copyrighted. It is best practice to use Google's license filter by clicking on *Tools* > *Usage Rights*, and clicking on the option *Creative Commons licenses*. This will reduce the risk of you violating copyright.
    - When you find the image you want, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it.
    - You can save the image in safe place on your computer, or you can copy the web address that belongs to the image you are selecting.

4. In Javascript, a string is created with text that is wrapped with either double quotation marks `""` or single quotation marks `''`. A number is created just by simply adding number with no quotation marks.

***Example:***

```
// This is a string

let variableString = "This is a string"

// This is a number

let variableNumber = 42
```

5. A `Variable` is a container where values are stored. Variables are most commonly delcared with the keywords `let`, `const`, `var`. A variable can also be delcared with no keywords.

***Example:***

```
let variableOne = 1;
const variableTwo = 2;
var variableThree = 3;
variableFour = 4;
```

## HTML

1. An HTML Attribute is extra information that is given to an element in HTML. Two examples of attributes are `class` and `Id`.

2. The anatomy of an HTML element:
    1. Opening tag: This consist of the name of the element, which is wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. Example: `<p>` - A paragraph element
    2. The content: The content of the element.
    3. Closing tag: Same as the opening tag, however, a forward slash `/` is used before the element name to show where element ends. Example: `</p>` - A closing paragraph element

3. The `<article>` element encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page, like a single blog post. The `<section>` element works similarly, however, it used more  for grouping a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality.

4. Elements a "typical" website would use:
    - `<title>`
    - `<h1>`
    - `<nav>`
    - `<p>`

5. How does Metadata influence Search Engine Optimization? By specifying a description that included keywords relating to the content. This raises the potential for the page to appear in relevant searches performed in search engines.

6. The `<meta>` element is used in the pages `<head>` section.

## Misc

### How to start to design a Website

1. The first step to designing a website listing ideas about your website, a process called "project ideation".

2. The most important question one should think of when designing a website: What do I want to accomplish with my website?

### Semantics

1. Why should you use an `<h1>` element over a `<span>` element to display a top level heading?

    The `<h1>` element is the appropriate element to use for a top level heading. The `<span>` element s a generic inline container for phrasing content.

2. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

    - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
    - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
    - Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless `div`s with or without semantic or namespaced classes
    - Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
    - Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

### What is Javascript?

1. Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?
    - HTML
    - CSS

2. How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?
    1. External
    2. Internal
    3. Inline
