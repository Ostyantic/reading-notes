# Audio, Video, Images

## Intro Statement

In this reading, we learn about a ton of new concepts. First we are introduced to two new HTML element, video and audio. Next we talk about display grid and its differences (and similarities) to flex. Lastly, we talk about responseive images which explains the benefits to use srcset and sizes to allow images to have extra responsiveness to different browser viewports.

## Video and Audio Content

### Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s

[From MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content#video_and_audio_on_the_web):

The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions `<video>` and `<audio>` elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.

### Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element

The `src` (source) attribute works the same as used in an img element, it contains a path to the video you want to embed. The `controls` attribute allows the user to control the video and audio playback, which is critical for users who have epilepsy.

### Why is it important to have **fallback content** inside the `<video>` element?

It is important to have fallback content incase the video cannot be loaded on the page. This is the same logic for images that cannot load, you want "fallback content" to describe the image.

### Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters

`<video>` is large TV and `<audio>` is the sound bar. The end.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

### How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

Grid is two dimensional while Flex is one dimensional

### Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences

- **Grid container**: Same as the a flex container, it’s the direct parent of all the grid items.
- **Grid item**: Same as the flex items, these are the children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.
- **Grid line**: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column.

## Responsive Images

### Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

Making images responsive allows images to be dynamically resized to fit different viewports, which adds to visual appeal.

### Define the following `<img>` attributes `srcset` and `sizes`. Write an example of how they are used

- `srcset`: specifies the URL of the image to use in different situations.
- `sizes`: defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true

### How is `srcset` more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

This one was a little difficult to explain in my own words, so I have referenced the information I found on MDN web docs.

[Why use `srcset` over CSS or JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#why_cant_we_just_do_this_using_css_or_javascript)

"When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images — hence the need to implement solutions like srcset. For example, you couldn't load the `<img>` element, then detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image as well, which is even worse in responsive image terms."
